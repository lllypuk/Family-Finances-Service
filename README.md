# Family Finances Service

**Modern family budget management system** with full-featured web interface, REST API, and advanced security features.

## 🎯 Project Status: IN DEVELOPMENT 🚧

This project is in **active development** with the following achievements:

- ✅ Complete web interface (HTMX v2.0.4 + PicoCSS v2.1.1)
- ✅ REST API for core entities (users, categories, transactions, budgets, invites, backups)
- ✅ Advanced security (authentication, authorization, CSRF protection)
- ✅ **Invite system** — user onboarding via secure token links
- ✅ **Backup management** — create, download, restore, and auto-cleanup
- ✅ **Admin panel** — user and invite management
- ✅ **Lightweight SQLite database** for simple deployment
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- ✅ **Single Docker container** — only 50MB
- ✅ Multi-platform builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Complete Web Interface**: Modern UI based on HTMX with responsive design
- 👥 **Role-Based Access Control**: Family Admin, Member, Child with different permissions
- 💰 **Advanced Budget Management**: Category limits, period tracking, overspending alerts
- 📈 **Real-Time Analytics**: Interactive dashboards with live updates
- 🎯 **Financial Goals Tracking**: Savings goals with progress visualization
- 🔐 **Enterprise Security**: Session management, CSRF protection, input validation
- 📊 **Reporting (mixed readiness)**: Web UI supports preview/save/view/delete and CSV export for reports; public report-generation REST API is still in progress
- 📨 **Invite System**: Secure registration via links with role control and expiration
- 💾 **Backup Management**: Create, download, restore DB with auto-cleanup (up to 10 backups)
- 🛠️ **Admin Panel**: User, invite, and backup management
- 🌐 **Multi-Platform Ready**: REST API, web interface, mobile-ready design

## API Readiness (Ready / Experimental)

### Ready (current behavior)

- Core REST API for users, categories, transactions, budgets
- Invite, admin, and backup management APIs/web flows
- Stored reports API endpoints: list, get by ID, delete
- Web reports UI: generate preview/save/view/delete/export CSV for expense, income, budget, cash-flow, and category-breakdown reports
- Web UI for day-to-day finance workflows

### Experimental / In Progress

- `POST /api/v1/reports` currently returns `501 Not Implemented` (report generation API is not exposed yet)
- Advanced analytics/report-generation features described in roadmap-style text are not fully available via public API
- Scheduled reports, forecasts, insights, and benchmark analytics remain hidden/placeholder service capabilities
- Treat "comprehensive reporting" as partial readiness: storage/retrieval is available, generation is pending

## 🏗️ Architecture and Technology Stack

### Backend (Production Ready)

## 🏛️ Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with production-ready implementations:

### Layer Structure

- **Domain layer** (`internal/domain/`): Business entities with comprehensive validation (User, Family, Invite,
  Transaction, Budget, etc.)
- **Services layer** (`internal/services/`): Business logic (invite, backup, budget, category, transaction, report,
  user)
- **Application layer** (`internal/application/`): HTTP server and handler orchestration
- **Web layer** (`internal/web/`): HTMX templates, middleware, authentication, admin panel
- **Infrastructure layer** (`internal/infrastructure/`): SQLite repositories and data persistence
- **Observability layer** (`internal/observability/`): Logging and health checks
