# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
- `make build` - Build the application (outputs to ./build/family-budget-service)
- `make run` - Run the application directly with go run
- `make run-local` - Run with local development environment variables (requires `make dev-up` first)

#### Local Development Setup
**Prerequisites**: Before running `make run-local`, you must start the required services:
```bash
make dev-up  # Starts MongoDB, Redis, and Mongo Express containers
make run-local  # Runs the application on localhost:8080
```

The `run-local` command sets up the following environment:
- **Server**: localhost:8080 (default port)
- **MongoDB**: mongodb://admin:password123@localhost:27017/family_budget?authSource=admin
- **Database**: family_budget (separate from production)
- **Redis**: redis://:redis123@localhost:6379 (optional caching)
- **Logging**: DEBUG level for development
- **Session Secret**: Development-specific secret key

#### Testing Local Interface
When testing the web interface locally, use the `--noproxy` flag to bypass proxy settings:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -s --noproxy '*' 127.0.0.1:8080/health

# Test main page
curl -s --noproxy '*' 127.0.0.1:8080/

# Test login page
curl -s --noproxy '*' 127.0.0.1:8080/login
```

### Testing and Code Quality
- `make test` - Run tests with shared MongoDB container (fast)
- `make test-unit` - Unit tests with fast containers
- `make test-integration` - Integration tests with shared container
- `make test-coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- `make lint` - Run golangci-lint for comprehensive code quality checks
- `make fmt` - Format code with go fmt
- `make pre-commit` - Run pre-commit checks (format, test, lint)

#### üöÄ Performance Optimization for Tests
The project includes **MongoDB container reuse** to dramatically speed up test execution:

**Fast container reuse strategies:**
- `REUSE_MONGO_CONTAINER=true` - Reuses MongoDB container across tests
- Each test gets a unique database (e.g., `testdb_1691234567890`)
- Automatic cleanup of test databases after each test
- Shared container cleanup on test suite completion

#### Code Quality Tools
The project uses **golangci-lint** with a comprehensive configuration (`.golangci.yml`) that includes:
- **Static analysis**: errcheck, govet, staticcheck, ineffassign
- **Code style**: gofmt, revive, whitespace alignment
- **Complexity checks**: gocognit, funlen, cyclop
- **Security**: gosec for security vulnerabilities
- **Best practices**: gocritic, unconvert, unused
- **Testing**: testifylint for proper test assertions

**IMPORTANT**: Always run `make lint` after completing any development work to ensure code quality standards. All linter errors must be fixed before committing changes.

**Workflow for development:**
1. Make your changes
2. Run `make fmt` to format code
3. Run `make test` to ensure tests pass
4. **Run `make lint` and fix ALL errors** - this is mandatory
5. Commit changes only after lint passes with 0 issues

### Dependencies and Maintenance
- `make deps` - Download and tidy Go modules
- `make clean` - Remove build artifacts and coverage reports
- `make generate` - Generate OpenAPI code

### Docker Environment
- `make dev-up` - Start development environment (MongoDB + Redis + Mongo Express)
- `make docker-up` - Start basic Docker containers (MongoDB, Redis)
- `make docker-down` - Stop Docker containers
- `make docker-logs` - View Docker container logs
- `make observability-up` - Start observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- `make full-up` - Start complete stack (app + observability)

The Docker environment includes:
- **MongoDB** (port 27017) with admin/password123 credentials
- **Mongo Express** web UI (port 8081) for database administration
- **Redis** (port 6379) for caching with password "redis123"
- **Observability Stack**: Prometheus (9090), Grafana (3000), Jaeger (16686)

## Architecture Overview

## üö® CRITICAL: Code Quality Requirements

**MANDATORY LINTER COMPLIANCE**: This project enforces strict code quality standards through golangci-lint.

### For ALL Development Work:

**After completing ANY task that modifies code, you MUST:**

1. **Run `make fmt`** - Format code according to project standards
2. **Run `make test`** - Ensure all tests pass
3. **Run `make lint`** - **MANDATORY** - Must result in 0 issues
4. **Fix ALL linter errors** - No exceptions, no compromises

### What the Linter Catches:
- Type errors and unused variables/imports
- Security vulnerabilities (gosec)
- Code style violations (revive, gofmt)
- Test assertion problems (testifylint)
- Performance issues (ineffassign)
- Complexity violations (funlen, cyclop)
- Best practices violations (gocritic)

### Zero Tolerance Policy:
- **0 linter issues** required before task completion
- **No bypassing** linter rules without explicit approval
- **All warnings must be addressed**
- If unable to resolve, escalate with specific error details

### Quick Fix Commands:
```bash
make fmt          # Auto-format code
make lint         # Check for issues
make pre-commit   # Run full check sequence
```

**Remember: Clean code is not optional - it's mandatory for project integrity.**
