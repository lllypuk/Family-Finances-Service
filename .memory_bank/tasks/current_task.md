# Comprehensive Test Fixing Plan

## Current Status
After running tests and analyzing the codebase, the project has **critical test failures** that prevent successful test execution. The issues fall into several categories requiring systematic fixes.

## Test Coverage Analysis
- **Overall Coverage**: 36.2% (needs improvement to 60%+)
- **Working Tests**: Domain models (88.9-100%), middleware (77.1%), observability (57.2%)
- **Failing Tests**: Application layer, services, infrastructure repositories, integration tests
- **Missing Tests**: Web handlers (0% coverage), integration helpers

## Priority 1: Critical Interface Signature Mismatches

### Problem
Repository interfaces have been updated to include `familyID` parameter for multi-tenancy, but mock implementations and test calls haven't been updated.

### Affected Components
- **Services Layer** (`internal/services/`):
  - `MockBudgetRepository.Delete()` - missing `familyID` parameter
  - `MockCategoryRepository.Delete()` - missing `familyID` parameter
  - `MockTransactionRepository.Delete()` - missing `familyID` parameter
  - `MockReportRepository.Delete()` - missing `familyID` parameter
  - `MockUserService.DeleteUser()` - missing `familyID` parameter

- **Application Handlers** (`internal/application/handlers/`):
  - All mock repositories have old signature for `Delete()` methods
  - Handler tests calling services without required `familyID`

- **Infrastructure Tests** (`internal/infrastructure/`):
  - Repository implementation tests calling `Delete()` without `familyID`
  - User repository missing validation methods (`ValidateEmail`, `SanitizeEmail`)

### Fix Strategy
1. **Update Mock Repositories** (2-3 hours):
   - Fix all mock `Delete()` method signatures in `internal/services/helpers_test.go`
   - Update handler mock repositories in `internal/application/handlers/*_test.go`
   - Add missing validation methods to user repository mocks

2. **Update Test Calls** (1-2 hours):
   - Fix all `DeleteBudget()`, `DeleteCategory()`, `DeleteTransaction()` calls
   - Add `familyID` parameters to all delete operations in tests
   - Update infrastructure repository tests

## Priority 2: Missing Integration Test Infrastructure

### Problem
Integration tests reference `testhelpers.SetupHTTPServer()` which doesn't exist, causing build failures.

### Missing Components
- `SetupHTTPServer()` function in testhelpers package
- HTTP test server configuration for integration tests
- Database setup/teardown for integration testing

### Fix Strategy
1. **Create Integration Test Helper** (3-4 hours):
   - Implement `SetupHTTPServer()` in `internal/testhelpers/`
   - Add HTTP server setup with real database connections
   - Include test database cleanup and isolation
   - Add test authentication and session management

2. **Update Integration Tests** (2-3 hours):
   - Fix imports and function calls in `tests/integration/*_test.go`
   - Ensure proper test isolation and cleanup
   - Add proper error handling and assertions

## Priority 3: User Repository Validation Methods

### Problem
User repository tests reference `ValidateEmail()` and `SanitizeEmail()` methods that don't exist on the repository.

### Root Cause
Methods are likely in validation package but tests expect them on repository.

### Fix Strategy
1. **Review Architecture** (30 minutes):
   - Check if methods should be on repository or validation package
   - Determine correct location based on domain design

2. **Fix Implementation** (1 hour):
   - Either add methods to repository or update tests to use validation package
   - Ensure consistent validation approach across codebase

## Priority 4: Web Handler Test Coverage

### Problem
Web handlers have 0% test coverage, critical for web interface reliability.

### Missing Tests
- Authentication handlers (`/login`, `/register`, `/logout`)
- Dashboard and navigation handlers
- HTMX endpoint handlers
- Form validation and error handling

### Fix Strategy
1. **Create Handler Test Framework** (2-3 hours):
   - Set up HTTP test infrastructure for web handlers
   - Add session and authentication mocking
   - Create test helpers for form submissions and HTMX requests

2. **Implement Handler Tests** (4-6 hours):
   - Authentication flow tests (login/logout/registration)
   - Dashboard rendering tests
   - HTMX endpoint tests with proper headers
   - Form validation and error display tests

## Priority 5: Service Layer Test Fixes

### Problem
Service tests have build failures due to interface mismatches, preventing coverage measurement.

### Fix Strategy
1. **Fix Mock Interfaces** (1-2 hours):
   - Update all service mocks in `internal/services/*_test.go`
   - Ensure consistency with actual service interfaces
   - Add missing methods to mocks

2. **Enhance Test Coverage** (3-4 hours):
   - Add missing business logic tests
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - Add validation and security tests

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Critical Fixes
- **Day 1-2**: Fix repository interface signatures (Priority 1)
- **Day 3-4**: Create integration test infrastructure (Priority 2)
- **Day 5**: Fix user repository validation (Priority 3)

### Week 2: Coverage Improvement
- **Day 1-3**: Implement web handler tests (Priority 4)
- **Day 4-5**: Fix and enhance service tests (Priority 5)

### Week 3: Optimization
- **Day 1-2**: Add missing edge case tests
- **Day 3**: Performance and benchmark tests
- **Day 4-5**: Documentation and test maintenance

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ All tests compile and run without build errors
- ✅ Overall test coverage increases from 36.2% to 60%+
- ✅ Web handlers achieve 40%+ coverage
- ✅ Integration tests run successfully with database isolation
- ✅ Service tests achieve 80%+ coverage

### Quality Standards
- ✅ All tests follow project conventions and patterns
- ✅ Proper mock usage and test isolation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling tests
- ✅ Security validation test coverage
- ✅ Performance regression test protection

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Database Schema Changes**: Integration tests may reveal schema inconsistencies
2. **Authentication Complexity**: Web handler tests need proper session mocking
3. **HTMX Specifics**: Need to handle HTMX-specific request/response patterns
4. **Performance Impact**: Comprehensive tests may slow CI pipeline

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Use test containers for database isolation
2. Create authentication test utilities
3. Build HTMX-aware test helpers
4. Implement parallel test execution and caching

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Priority 1** - Fix critical interface mismatches to get tests compiling
2. **Create working baseline** - Ensure existing tests pass before adding new ones
3. **Incremental progress** - Fix one test file at a time to maintain functionality
4. **Regular validation** - Run `make test` and `make lint` after each fix
5. **Documentation updates** - Update test documentation as improvements are made

This plan addresses the immediate test failures while establishing a foundation for long-term test quality improvement.
